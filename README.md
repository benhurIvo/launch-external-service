# launch external service from Java

In this project, we launch an external process from java. The simple web server when running is ever ready to accept hyper text transfer
protocol (http) requests from a client (in this case a browser) and processes the request once received. It
uses the java.net.ServerSocket class to wait for incoming calls, then creates a socket object which is
used to communicate with the client
